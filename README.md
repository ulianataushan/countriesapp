# [Countries App]()

The app contains information about 250 countries fetched from an [API endpoint](https://restcountries.com/).

This is your final project for the frontend module

The project was built with a purpose of practicing the technologies that I learned and combining them in a single application.

### Stack used:

- TypeScript
- React.js (hooks, react-router)
- Redux Toolkit
- Material-UI

### Follow [this link]() to check out the app.
