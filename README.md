# [Countries App]()

The app contains information about 250 countries fetched from an [API endpoint](https://restcountries.com/).

On the homepage, users can search for a specific country using the search field, sort the country list by the name. Clicking on the name of a certain country takes the user to a separate country page with the detailed information about the selected country. Each country can be added to favorites, which can then be viewed from a favorites page.

The project was built with a purpose of practicing the technologies that I learned and combining them in a single application.

### Stack used:

- TypeScript
- React.js (hooks, react-router)
