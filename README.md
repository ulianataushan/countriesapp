# Frontend React Project

## Instructions
### Step 1

- Fetch all the countries and return the data from [countries APIs](https://restcountries.com/). Display the data on the screen

- Given a country name as argument, returns the data about that country from [countries APIs](https://restcountries.com/).

### Step 2

- Render the data of all the countries (from Step 1) in a table, you can use html table tag, or component library like Material UI
- Make sure to split the table into smaller components: `TableHead`, `TableBody`, `TableRow`

### Step 3

- Integrate react router into your project and create 2 pages: `home`, and `country`
- Homepage will contain the countries table that we created above
- Country page will render the data about one specific country only
- When a user click on the name of the country in the table, they will be routed to the `country` page

### Step 4

- Set up all the redux boilerblate for the project
- Everything related to redux stays in one folder: reducers, store
- Think about what reducer you're going to make and write them accordingly
- Move the state that contains all countries to redux store

### Step 5

Take your time to implement the following features:

- Implement a search bar to search for a country
- Add/remove the countries to/from favorite list using Redux
- Sort the table based on name, region, etc.
- Maker sure the favorite list is saved in local storage to persist across refreshes of the page.
