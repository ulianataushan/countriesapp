# [Countries App]()

The app contains information about 250 countries fetched from an [API endpoint](https://restcountries.com/).

On the homepage, users can search for a specific country using the search field, and sort the country list by the name.
Clicking on the name of a certain country takes the user to a separate country page which contains more detailed information about the selected country as well as a link to this country in Google Maps.
Clicking on the heart next to a country adds it to the favorits list. All favorite countries can be viewed form the favorite page. A link to it, as well as the link to the homepage can be found in the navigation menu in the top right corner.

The project was built with a purpose of practicing the technologies that I learned and combining them in a single application.

### Stack used:

- TypeScript
- React.js (hooks, react-router)
